##Aim of the assignement
Three different versions of parallel programs have to be made, using:

  +   pthreads
  +   cilk
  +   openmp
  
that implement the quicksort algorithm.  
<br>
The programs should check if the result is correct and work for $2^{p}$ threads where $p \in [1:8]$ and for $2^{n}$ elements to be sorted, where $n \in [12:24]$.  
`n` , `p` are defined by the user.  
<br>
Then, the speed of the sequential and the three parallel quicksort versions(and other implementations of them) will be compared, for different number of threads and elements.
