## Final Comparison
Since the optimal number of maximum threads and number of elements for parallelisation have been determined, it's time to compare the programms, sequential and parallel, for different problem sizes.
*(The yellow line is `nlogn`)*
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('../data_scripts/plots_for_n_final.R')
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
<<plotbarN>>
```

 *Figure 3.1* shows that for `n` larger than `19`, there is a noticable difference in speed, between the parallel and the sequencial programms. Also, the growth rate of the sequentials is `O(nlogn)` , while the parallel's rate of growth is obviously less. The stdlib qsort is slower , evan than the sequnetial, propably because of the use of pointer arguments and pointer to function.
 
 From *Figure 3.2* it is apparent that all four programms have the same speed for various `n`, with Cilk being the winner by a very narrow margin.
