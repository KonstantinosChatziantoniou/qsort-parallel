## Final Comparison
Since the optimal number of maximum threads and number of elements for parallelisation have been determined, it's time to compare the programs, sequential and parallel, for different problem sizes.
*(The yellow line is `nlogn`)*

 *Figure 3.1* shows that for `n` smaller than `19`, there is not a noticable difference in speed, between the parallel and the sequencial programs. The stdlib qsort is slower , evan than the sequnetial, propably because of the use of pointer arguments and pointer to function. For $n=17$, parallel programs start to be 2x faster than the sequnetials and for $n=24$, they are almost 3x faster than the sequnetial and almost 4x faster than the stdlib's qsort. 
 
 From *Figure 3.2* it is apparent that all four programs have the same speed for various `n`, with Cilk being the winner by a very narrow margin.
