##Optimal number of elements for parallelisation(grain size)
Creating and terminating a thread introduces some overhead. When the problem size is small, this overhead may make the parallel programm slower than the sequential. So, an optimal number of elements `n` should be found\footnote{Number of elements `n` is different for each machine.}, below which sequential approach will be used.

```{r echo=FALSE}
  knitr::read_chunk('../data_scripts/plot_for_minN.R')
```
```{r echo = FALSE , fig.height= 3}
<<plotbarminN>>
```

From *figure 1* it is apparent that `cilk` and `openmp` are not affected much by small grain size, propably because of the automatic optimisation. Pthread ,though, is at least 10% slower for low grain size( n < 13 ). All parallel programms are at least 8% slower for large grain size(n > 20). As optimal minimum number for parallelisation we will choose:

  + Cilk  $n = 13$
  + Openmp $n = 14$
  + Pthread $n = 18$
  + Pthread.9000 $n = 17$
