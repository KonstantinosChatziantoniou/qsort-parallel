###Diades remote server

The programs were also run on the diades server(4 cores with hyperthreading). The parallel programs, for $2^{24}$ elements and their optimal treads and grainsize , took approximately 0.42s , while the sequnetial took 2.5s (6x faster). This indicates tha multithreaded
programs benefit more from more threads(diades) than singlethreaded performance(laptop). It also proves that the comparison results differ greatly for differnt systems.
